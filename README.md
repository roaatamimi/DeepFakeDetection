# Deepfake Detection Model

## Overview
A machine learning model that detects deepfake images using CNN and Capsule Networks to protect against malicious fake content.

## Problem
- Deepfakes threaten security and can harm individuals
- Easy creation of fake images spreads misinformation
- Need advanced detection to combat malicious uses

## Solution
Our model combines:
- **CNN Encoder**: Extracts features from images
- **Capsule Networks**: Detects anomalies and specific patterns
  - Some capsules recognize face shapes
  - Others identify skin textures
  - Designed to spot inconsistencies in fake images

## How It Works
1. Load real and fake image datasets
2. Use pretrained CNN to extract image features
3. Pass features to Capsule Network layers
4. Train on batches of real vs fake images
5. Model learns to distinguish authentic from manipulated content

## Inspiration
Built upon previous work including Facebook's DFGC challenge solutions that used transfer learning and facial recognition techniques.

## Tech Stack
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Capsule Networks
- Transfer Learning
- Computer Vision

## Goal
Create a robust detection system to safeguard against deepfake threats and protect digital media integrity.
